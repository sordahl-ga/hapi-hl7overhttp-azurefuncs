/**
 * <p>
 * Minimal Lower Layer Protocol implementation which is detects the text
 * character set being used by reading in the MSH-18 value. For example, if
 * MSH-18 contains "ISO-8859-1", the message is parsed using 8859/1 charset
 * encoding. If MSH-18 contains "UNICODE UTF-8", the message is parsed using
 * UTF-8 charset encoding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please note the following warnings regarding the use of this class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * At present, this class supports only the ER7 (pipe and hat) message style.
 * Using it to receive an XML style message will result in undefined behaviour.</li>
 * <li>
 * This class attempts to detect UTF-16 encoding by searching for a byte order
 * mark at the beginning of the string. While the BOM is optional in UTF-16
 * encoding, this class will not correctly detect UTF-16 if it is missing. Both
 * big-endian and little-endian byte order is supported for UTF-16.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
