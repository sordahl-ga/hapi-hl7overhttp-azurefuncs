/**
 * Default implementation of a HiLo ID generator that allows to use another
 * (non-HiLo) ID generator for generating the "hi" part of the ID. The delegate
 * must increment its ID is discrete steps > 1, so that the gaps can be filled
 * with "lo" IDs.
 * <p>
 *     Example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *     Hi IDs: 0, 100, 200, 300 (increment = 100)
 *     Lo IDs: 1,2,3,...,100,1,2,3,....
 *     Resulting ID (Hi + Lo): 1,2,3,99,100,101,102,...
 * </pre>
