/**
 * <p>Used to navigate the nested group structure of a message.  This is an alternate
 * way of accessing parts of a message, ie rather than getting a segment through
 * a chain of getXXX() calls on the message, you can create a MessageNavigator
 * for the message, "navigate" to the desired segment, and then call
 * getCurrentStructure() to get the segment you have navigated to.  A message
 * navigator always has a "current location" pointing to some structure location (segment
 * or group location) within the message.  Note that a location exists whether or
 * not there are any instances of the structure at that location. </p>
 * <p>This class is used by Terser, which presents an even more convenient way
 * of navigating a message.  </p>
 * <p>This class also has an iterate() method, which iterates over
 * segments (and optionally groups).  </p>
