/**
 * MessageID generator interface. This is a replacement for the legacy
 * MessageIDGenerator class, which should not be used anymore.
 * <p>
 * An instance implementing this interface can be configured by setting the
 * property in the {@link ca.uhn.hl7v2.parser.ParserConfiguration} class and
 * will then be used to generate IDs for all messages created by HAPI. The
 * default implementation is {@link FileBasedHiLoGenerator}.
 * <p>
 * HAPI does not provide ID generators that depend on external resources (except
 * for files). Implementors are encouraged to add their own classes
 * (implementing {@link IDGenerator.Ordered}, e.g. based on database tables
 * or sequences, and use it as delegate in {@link DelegatingHiLoGenerator}.
