		<section name="Downloading HAPI">

			<p>
				If you aren't using Maven, HAPI can be downloaded at our
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hl7api/files/hl7api/">Sourceforge Download Site.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				Adding HAPI to your application requires one or more HAPI JARs
				to be added to your application classpath.
			</p>

			<subsection name="HAPI Libraries">

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">hapi-base-${hapi_version_stable}.jar</span>
						</td>
						<td>
							This is the base HAPI library. It contains parsers, transports, validators, etc.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">hapi-structures-v21-${hapi_version_stable}.jar</span>
							<br />
							<span class="nobr">hapi-structures-v22-${hapi_version_stable}.jar</span>
							<br />
							etc...
						</td>
						<td>
							Each HL7 version (2.1, 2.2, etc) has a messsage library contained
							within a structures JAR. If you are constructing messages of that
							particular version of HL7, you should include the
							appropriate JAR.
						</td>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">hapi-hl7overhttp-${hapi_version_stable}.jar</span>
						</td>
						<td>
							If you are using
							<a href="hapi-hl7overhttp/index.html">HL7 over HTTP</a>
							in your
							application, you must include the hl7overhttp JAR as well.
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="HAPI Dependencies">

				<p>
					HAPI also requires the following JARs to function. Newer versions of these JARs *should* also work.
					Note that these dependencies can be found in the "hapi-all" bundle available in the
					Download
					area.
				</p>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">slf4j-api-${slf4j_version}.jar</span>
						</td>
						<td>
							HAPI uses
							<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a>
							for logging.
							SLF4J is a logging abstraction framework which generally uses
							an underlying logger to write the logs to disk. At a minimum, you
							must include the "slf4j-api" dependency JAR, but you
							should also
							include a binding to an underlying log system.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">log4j-${log4j_version}.jar</span>
							<br />
							<span class="nobr">slf4j-log4j12-${slf4j_version}.jar</span>
						</td>
						<td>
							<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">LOG4J</a>
							is a good choice for an
							underlying log system (the library which actually writes the logs to
							disk). You may include these two JARs to use LOG4J (to
							be clear, this
							is optional. HAPI has no
							dependencies on LOG4J but will take advantage
							of its functionality through SLF4J's bridge.)
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<span class="nobr">slf4j-api-${slf4j_version}.jar</span>
							<br />
							<span class="nobr">xml-apis-1.4.01.jar</span>
							<br />
							<span class="nobr">xml-resolver-1.2.jar</span>
						</td>
						<td>
							When HAPI runs on older Java versions (particularly Java 1.4.x) and XML-related functions are used (including parsing XML messages and working with conformance profiles),
							you have to add
							these libraries.
						</td>
					</tr>

		<section name="Using Maven">

			<p>
				To use HAPI in a
				<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
				based project,
				add the hapi-base artifact to your dependencies section,
				as well as any structure JAR versions you need.
			</p>

			<source><![CDATA[<!-- This is the core HAPI library -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>ca.uhn.hapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>hapi-base</artifactId>
  <version>${hapi_version_stable}</version>
</dependency>       

<!-- These are structure JARs for HL7 v2.1 and 2.5.1 (as an example) -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>ca.uhn.hapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>hapi-structures-v21</artifactId>
  <version>${hapi_version_stable}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>ca.uhn.hapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>hapi-structures-v251</artifactId>
  <version>${hapi_version_stable}</version>
</dependency>]]></source>

			<p>
				If you wish to use LOG4J, add the following as well:
			</p>

			<source><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
  <version>${slf4j_version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
  <version>${log4j_version}</version>
</dependency>
]]></source>

			<p>
				If you are using HL7 over HTTP, include the "hapi-hl7overhttp"
				dependency as well.
			</p>

			<source><![CDATA[<dependency>
  <groupId>ca.uhn.hapi</groupId>
  <artifactId>hapi-hl7overhttp</artifactId>
  <version>${hapi_version_stable}</version>
</dependency>]]></source>

		</section>

		<section name="What Next?">

			<p>
				Once you have the library downloaded and added to a project,
				see the
				<a href="devbyexample.html">HAPI By Example</a>
				page for what to try
				next.
			</p>
