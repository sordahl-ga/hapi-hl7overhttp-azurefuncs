HAPI
---------
Thanks for downloading HAPI!

    You have downloaded a SOURCE distribution of HAPI - the open-sourced HL7 library.
    
    Note that this is not the standard distribution of HAPI! If you are simply looking
    to include HAPI in your application, you probably want the regular binary 
    distribution of HAPI. Please visit our website for more information: 
        http://hl7api.sourceforge.net
    
    For information about HAPI's license, please visit 
        http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/license.html
    
    This package also contains several libraries which are licensed under other 
    license agreements.

--------
What's in this distribution?

    This distribution contains only HAPI's source, and can be used to build a copy
    of the library from source.

-------
Building HAPI

    To build a library, you must install the Maven build tool, available at
        http://maven.apache.org
    Note that you must be using at least version 2.0.0, and version 2.1.0 or newer 
    is recommended.
    
    As with most maven projects, the build command is as follows:
        mvn install
