Using HAPI under JDK 1.4

  As of version 1.0 of HAPI, a JDK version 5.0 or newer is needed by default. Using JDK
  1.4 is still possible however, using the "JDK14" distribution available on the
  {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/hl7api/files/hl7api/}Download}} page.

  This distribution is produced by taking the JDK 5 compiled classes and
  applying {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/retrotranslator-maven-plugin/}Retrotranslator}}.
